This micro-site was edited from [Bentway's _Digital and/as Public Space_ initiative website](https://www.thebentway.ca/stories/digital-and-as-public-space/), which was developed and designed by [Hypha Coop](https://hypha.coop/). 

Hypha is a worker co-operative based in Toronto which helps organizations and communities redesign their relationships with digital technology. 

The _Digital and/as Public Space_ initiative explores the new reality of hybrid realms that blend digital and physical spaces.

The original source code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/hyphacoop/digitalgarden).

[Work Sans](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans) is a typeface designed by [Wei Huang](http://charlix.cx/) based loosely on early Grotesques.

## Layout
{:.anthony.f1.normal.mb3}

The layout of the micro-site was developed with [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) a modular CSS library with a few extended features.

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a JavaScript library for visualizing data, is used to create the interactive knowledge graph. Originally from [Digital garden Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt.
