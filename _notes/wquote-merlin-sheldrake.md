"'Human economic systems are many and diverse. Yet the body of theory known as biological market frameworks bears a striking resemblance to free “market capitalism”.' Would it help to compare the value of economic models drawn from different cultural systems? There are many ways to attribute value. There might be other currencies that haven’t been taken into account."
