A poster design for Handsworth Highschool's Annual Musical Production. The poster was designed with prompts and feedback from the schoolâ€™s theatre director and advanced media studies teacher as a final project over the course of three weeks. The project challenged my ability to design for a client and my ability to communicate hidden meaning through art and design.
