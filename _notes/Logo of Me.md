LOGO, GRAPHICS

As a part of my first-year University graphic design courseâ€™s final project, we had to create a logo representing ourselves. MR is also an abbreviation and play on words here for the term "mister", which I felt allows me to combine and invoke in viewers the fact that playfulness and authority/capability can co-exist with each other.
