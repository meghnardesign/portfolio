“This is a very big place, and I do not know how it works, or how I fit in. I am a member of a fragile species, still new to the earth, the youngest creatures of any scale, here only a few moments as evolutionary time is measured, a juvenile species, a child of a species. We are only tentatively set in place, error-prone, at risk of fumbling, in real danger at the moment of leaving behind only a thin layer of our fossils, radioactive at that. We are anomalies for the moment, the self-conscious children at the edge of the crowd, unsure of our place, tending to grabbiness…But we are not as bad a lot as some of us say…At our worst, we may be going through the early stages of a species’ adolescence, and everyone remembers what that is like. Growing up is hard times for an individual, but sustained torment for a whole species, especially as brainy and nervous as ours. If we can last it out, get through the phase… we might find ourselves off and running again.”
