Older trees connected through a mycelium network have been shown to move nutrients into the mycelial network to help nourish younger trees in the network as they struggle to establish themselves. Dying trees connected to a common mycorrhizal network are also known to distribute their resources stores back into the network to nourish other plants in the ecosystem, even species other than its own. As such, older, more mature trees act as anchors within the ecosystem and ‚Äúkeep watch‚Äù over newly forming life, while also allowing turnover and power redistribution to occur within the ecosystem to sustain new life that is emerging.
