title: Critical Connections

A mushroom is the fruit of a  mycelium network. Mushrooms only form once this underground network is established enough and the conditions are right. With an increased number of connections, the mycelium network can depend on different plant individuals and species for food and in turn, more plants can communicate and send different resources to one another in times of need or danger. While developing a well connected mycelial network may take some time, having multiple and alternate transport and communication connections increases the resilience of the entire system. Putting in energy and resources into a few strong connections may be more beneficial than into multiple smaller ones and vice versa at various stages of the network development.
