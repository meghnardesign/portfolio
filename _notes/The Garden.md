Hi and welcome to my digital garden. This is a space for me to publish my work, my thoughts and everything in between, as I learn and grow as a person and digital designer. Digital gardens are a great alternative design to traditional personal websites in that they encourage visitors to slow down and explore, while also making good use of features such as backlinks, which allow me (and you) to connect topics, ideas and projects to each other in a more intuitive and explicit way.

Enjoy!
