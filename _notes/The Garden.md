Hi and welcome to my digital garden. This is a space for me to publish my work, my thoughts and everything in between, as I learn and grow as a person and digital designer. To me digital gardens an alternative design to traditional personal websites in that they encourage visitors to slow down and explore, while also making good use of features such as backlinks, which allow me (and you) to connect topics and projects to each other and see the both the trees and forest so to speak.

Enjoy!
