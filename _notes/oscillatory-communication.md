In the absence of centralised control, there is evidence that mycelium networks use oscillatory rhythms to coordinate behaviour in heterogeneous environments to propagate information and efficiently transmit nutrients. While constant, open communication and nutrient transport throughout the network may be energy intensive, frequent and repetitive activity can be a good substitute to check in on the health and needs of the network. This system of communication and action is also seen in other distributed systems such as slime and in particular, neural communication within the brain. Neurons are assembled to create assemblages with distinct specialisations; in order to communicate and connect these assemblages, the central nervous system groups and synchronises neural activity in bursts of oscillations within and between these assemblies to prevent having to control each neuron separately. Each neuron is aware of its state and the state of the neurons around it to which it then responds in kind to, allowing signals to propagate throughout the network. This process is recognized as a precise and efficient mechanism for long-range communication between different groups.
