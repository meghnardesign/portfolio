Meghna Rajamohan, *Digital Designer*

Hello! I’m Meghna Rajamohan, a current student in the Interactive Arts & Technology program at Simon Fraser University, and a future UI/UX designer. I’m a passionate and driven student with a love for design and how it can be leveraged to support social cohesion and human connection. My goal in the field of media and design is to show people that challenges can be reimagined and reshaped to create a better future through the tool of design and how it interacts with people!
