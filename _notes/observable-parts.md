Self-regulation becomes possible when an organism has mechanisms in place to observe its current state and needs, as well as that of its environment. In the mycorrhizal network, signals are often sent and received through waves of communication and touch points for direct communication within and around plant roots in order to create a coordinated response. With each part of the network aware of the state of surrounding parts, signals can be propagated through the network through awareness and observation of nearby parts. Energy and time can be conserved if each part observes the state of nearby others to facilitate efficient communication.
