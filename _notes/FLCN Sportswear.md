BRANDING, LOGO

A first-year university class project that aimed to help students develop and apply their skills in basic visual imagery and design principles. Students create a company name, concept and logo based on two given prompts. I aimed to challenge my creative skills and improve my ability to design for a client rather than myself with this project.
