Asexual reproduction occurs either with vegetative spores or through mycelia fragmentation. In the former, a mycelial network fruits mushrooms which contain spores inside their gills. The spores are then spread and germinate to create a dense network of fungal threads known as hyphae, which then assemble into much more complex structures to form mycelium. In turn, the mycelium join together to create a mycorrhizal network. In mycelial fragmentation, the mycelium separates into pieces and each piece then grows into a separate mycelium.
