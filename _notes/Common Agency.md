WEB DESIGN

Common Agency is a community organization that is actively working on strengthening neighbourhood trust and cohesion through the creation of "neighbourhood networks", online platforms that aim to get people talking to each other and to mobilize around common interests. The goal of this project was to introduce Common Agencyâ€™s audience to their platform, Neighbourhood Network, through basic webpages that reflected their vision and project goals through UI/UX Design.
