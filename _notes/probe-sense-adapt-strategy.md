Mycelium networks grow by releasing enzymes that act as catalysts for breakdown and acquiring nutrients as well as playing a key role in mycelium growth and reproduction as once a network is strong enough, the mycelium will fruit into spore-carrying mushrooms. Depending on the needs of the network and the type and quantity of nutrients that result from enzymes breaking down nearby organic and non-organic matter, the mycelium will choose whether to produce more enzymes and proliferate in this area to expand the network. While the network explores many initially, the ones which yield the best nutrient results for the network's current needs will have more energy placed in them through enzyme release and biomass accumulation, until the process starts again as the network expands into other unfamiliar areas. A sensemaking strategy for finding the most fertile ways forward in unfamiliar environments.
